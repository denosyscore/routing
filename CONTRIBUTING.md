# Contributing

We appreciate your interest in contributing to **DenosysCore Routing!**
Your contributions are essential to helping us build and maintain a high-quality project. Here's how you can get involved and make a difference:

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/denosyscore/routing).

## Types of Contributions

- **Reporting Bugs:** If you find any issues, please clearly describe the problem, include steps to reproduce it, and relevant system environment details. See the **"Submitting Bug Reports"** section below for more guidance.

- **Suggesting Features:** Got ideas for enhancements? Share them! Describe your proposed feature, the use cases it addresses, and how it would benefit the project. See **"Proposing New Features"** below.

- **Submitting Code Changes:** Create pull requests to fix bugs, introduce improvements, or add new features. Please ensure your changes adhere to guidelines in this document.

- **Improving Documentation:** Help us make the documentation clear and helpful. Whether it's fixing typos, clarifying concepts, or adding examples, your contributions are valued.

## Guidelines

- **Coding Style:** We follow the [PSR-12 Coding Standard](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/). Use [PHP Code Sniffer](http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer) to help maintain consistency.

- **Testing Thoroughness:** Write comprehensive tests to go with your code with changes. This ensures changes function properly and prevents regressions in the future.

- **Documentation:** Update `README.md` or other relevant files as needed to reflect your changes. Clear documentation is essential for user and future developer understanding.

- **API & Release Compatibility:** Consider our commitment to [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Avoid introducing breaking changes unless absolutely necessary and discussed with maintainers.

- **Branching Workflow:** Create separate feature branches for your contributions. Don't submit pull requests directly from your main branch.

- **Focused Pull Requests:** Keep pull requests focused on a single feature or change. This streamlines review and merging.

- **Meaningful Commits:** Break down your work into well-defined commits with descriptive commit messages for easier review.

## Submitting Bug Reports

Before submitting a new issue, check for existing ones to avoid duplicates. When submitting a bug report, please include:

- **Clear Title:** Briefly summarize the issue.
- **Steps to Reproduce:** Detailed steps on how to consistently trigger the bug.
- **System Information:** Operating system, relevant libraries and versions, browser info (if applicable).
- **Expected vs. Actual Behavior:** Describe what you expect to happen and what actually occurs.
- **Visuals:** If possible, provide screenshots or screen recordings highlighting the problem.

## Proposing New Features

We welcome your ideas! When proposing a new feature:

- **Search Existing Discussions:** First, see if a similar discussion or feature request already exists.
- **Describe the Use Case:** Explain how this feature will benefit users.
- **Outline Your Solution (Optional):** If you have a rough implementation plan, feel free to share it.


## Running Tests

``` bash
$ vendor/bin/phpunit

**We look forward to your valuable contributions**!
